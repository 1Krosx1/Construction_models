    "An in-depth analysis of the provided MATLAB and Python scripts reveals a remarkably similar workflow for data visualization and model training, despite their syntactical and ecosystem differences. Both scripts follow a structured, seven-section process to achieve the same goal: predicting project budgets based on architectural features. Here’s a breakdown of the insights, similarities, and differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Both MATLAB and Python prove to be highly capable environments for this machine learning task. The choice between them often comes down to user preference, industry standards, and specific project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **MATLAB:** Presents a more integrated and streamlined environment, particularly for engineers and researchers comfortable with matrix-based operations. Its toolboxes, such as the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and the Deep Learning Toolbox, provide a comprehensive suite of functions for various stages of the machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "*   **Python:** Offers a more versatile, open-source ecosystem with a vast collection of specialized libraries. For data science and machine learning, libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch/TensorFlow are the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities in the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The core logic and workflow of both scripts are nearly identical, demonstrating a standardized approach to solving machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Structured Workflow:** Both scripts are divided into seven distinct sections, starting from setup and data loading, moving through feature engineering, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and finally saving the assets. This modular structure enhances readability and maintainability.\n",
    "*   **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Both scripts begin by loading two CSV files. They then perform similar cleaning operations, such as handling missing values and renaming columns.\n",
    "*   **Feature Engineering:** This is a crucial and parallel step in both scripts. They both:\n",
    "    *   Extract a \"Budget\" value from a descriptive string column.\n",
    "    *   Create new \"granular cost features\" by multiplying the quantity of a material by its unit cost.\n",
    "    *   Derive \"Num_Storeys\" and \"Num_Classrooms\" from the project description text using regular expressions.\n",
    "    *   Apply a log transformation (`log1p`) to the target variable (`Budget`) to handle its skewed distribution.\n",
    "*   **Data Splitting and Scaling:** Both scripts split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. They also both employ feature scaling: MATLAB uses `zscore` (standardization), and Python uses `StandardScaler`. The target variable is scaled to a range in both, with MATLAB performing it manually and Python using `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
    "*   **Neural Network Architecture:** The architecture of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is conceptually the same:\n",
    "    *   An input layer matching the number of features.\n",
    "    *   A series of fully connected (or \"dense\") layers with decreasing numbers of neurons (128 -> 64 -> 32).\n",
    "    *   ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions after each hidden layer to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "    *   Dropout layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    *   A single-neuron output layer for the regression task.\n",
    "*   **Model Training:** Both use the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for training neural networks. They also train for a similar number of epochs (200) with a mini-batch size of 16.\n",
    "*   **Evaluation:** The evaluation process is identical. They both:\n",
    "    *   Make predictions on the scaled test set.\n",
    "    *   Inverse-transform the predictions back to the original scale.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the same performance metrics: R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "    *   Generate a scatter plot comparing the actual versus predicted budget values to visually assess the model's performance.\n",
    "*   **Saving Artifacts:** Both scripts conclude by saving the trained model and the scalers used for data preprocessing, which is essential for deploying the model on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences in the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary differences lie in the syntax and the specific libraries or toolboxes used to implement each step.\n",

    "In summary, while the implementation details and the tools used differ, the underlying methodology for this data science project is consistent across both MATLAB and Python. This highlights a convergence of best practices in the field of machine learning, regardless of the programming language."
