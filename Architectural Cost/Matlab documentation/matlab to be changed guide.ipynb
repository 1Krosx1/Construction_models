    "### **Guide to Adapting the MATLAB ANN Code for a New Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This document serves as a guide for modifying the provided MATLAB scripts to train a new Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on a different dataset. By following these instructions, you can reuse the existing code architecture, saving significant development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves updating three key files:\n",
    "1.  **`guide_matlab.m`**: The main script that controls the entire workflow.\n",
    "2.  **`clean_table.m`**: A helper function for initial data cleaning and preparation.\n",
    "3.  **`extract_budget.m`**: A helper function for custom feature extraction from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `guide_matlab.m` (Main Script)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where most of the high-level changes will occur, from loading data to defining the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Section 2: Data Loading, Cleaning, and Merging**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **File Paths (Lines 26-27 & 32-34)**:\n",
    "    *   **What to change**: The names of your input CSV files.\n",
    "    *   **Reason**: You will be working with new data files.\n",
    "    *   **Original Code**:\n",
    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        opts_qty = detectImportOptions('Thesis Data - Architectural Quantity Cost.csv', ...);\n",
    "        T_quantity = readtable('Thesis Data - Architectural Quantity Cost.csv', opts_qty);\n",
    "        T_unit_cost = readtable('Thesis Data - Achitectural Unit Cost.csv', opts_cost);\n",

    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Target Variable Extraction (Lines 46-52)**:\n",
    "    *   **What to change**: The logic for extracting your target variable (the value you want to predict). The original code uses a custom `extract_budget` function on a specific column. Your new project may have the target in its own clean column already.\n",
    "    *   **Reason**: Your new dataset will have a different target variable and column structure.\n",
    "    *   **Original Code**:\n",
    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        budgets = rowfun(@extract_budget, T_quantity_cleaned(:, 'Year/Budget'), ...);\n",

    "        T_quantity_cleaned.('Year/Budget') = [];\n",

    "    *   **Example Change (if 'Price' is already a column)**:\n",
    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        % This section might be simplified or removed if the target is already clean.\n",
    "        % For example, you might just rename the column:\n",

    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Table Merging (Line 55)**:\n",
    "    *   **What to change**: The join key (`'Join_Key'`) or the type of join (`innerjoin`).\n",
    "    *   **Reason**: You may not need to merge tables, or you might use a different common column (e.g., 'ID', 'Project_Name').\n",
    "    *   **Original Code**:\n",
    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        T_merged = innerjoin(T_quantity_cleaned, T_unit_cost_cleaned, 'Keys', 'Join_Key');\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Data Filtering (Lines 58-60)**:\n",
    "    *   **What to change**: The filtering conditions. The original code removes rows with a `Budget` below 100,000.\n",
    "    *   **Reason**: These filters are specific to the original project's domain and data quality.\n",
    "    *   **Original Code**:\n",
    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        T_merged = T_merged(~isnan(T_merged.Budget), :);\n",
    "        T_merged = T_merged(T_merged.Budget > 100000, :);\n",
    "        ```\n",

    "        ```matlab\n",
    "        T_merged = T_merged(T_merged.Target > 0, :); // Keep only houses with a positive price\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Custom Feature Extraction from Text (Lines 111-144)**:\n",

    "    *   **Reason**: This logic is highly specific to the project descriptions in the original dataset. You will need to write new rules for your new data.\n",
